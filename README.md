# Getting Started with Create React App

Project following the guidelines of React and Typescript course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJDVKeh7RJI

## Install sass
npm i sass
create a file with extension .scss
import the file .scss into the components and start use it!! :)

## Install eslint and prettier
React already come with eslint 
When you run npm start it checks eslint according to eslint configuration

but if you have a react app without eslint and prettier
ESLint is responsible for checking against programming errors, on the other hand, we have Prettier an opinionated code formatter capable of finding any stylistic errors

npm install --save-dev eslint prettier

npm run lint -> to run eslint checks

For format the code using prettier

npm install --save-dev prettier


## Run the project
npm run build
npx serve -s build
